# Plus One

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Plus One" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.


## Example
### Input:
digits = [1,2,3]
### Output:
[1,2,4]
### Explanation:
The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4]
