# Is Subsequence

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Is Subsequence" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


## Example
### Input:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
### Output:
true
