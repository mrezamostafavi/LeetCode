# Group Anagrams

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Group Anagrams" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.


## Example
### Input:
strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
### Output:
[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
### Explanation:
There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

# Note
This code includes some additional parts compared to the code I used on LeetCode.
I have two solutions here. While the first one works correctly, it encounters a time limit error on LeetCode. Therefore, I decided to optimize it, and the final result, which is accepted by LeetCode, is in the solution_2 file.
