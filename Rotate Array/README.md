# Rotate Array

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Rotate Array" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

## Example
### Input:
nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
### Output:
[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
### Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
