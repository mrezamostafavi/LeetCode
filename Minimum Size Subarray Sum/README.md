# Minimum Size Subarray Sum

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Minimum Size Subarray Sum" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges. The solution merges two sorted integer arrays into a single sorted array in-place.

## Problem Description

Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.


## Example
### Input:
target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]

### Output:
2
### Explanation
The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
