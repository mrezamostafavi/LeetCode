# Contains Duplicate II

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Contains Duplicate II" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

## Example 1
### Input:
nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
### Output:
true


## Example 2
### Input:
nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
### Output:
false

# Note
This code includes some additional parts compared to the code I used on LeetCode.
I have two solutions here. While the first one works correctly, it encounters a time limit error on LeetCode. Therefore, I decided to optimize it, and the final result, which is accepted by LeetCode, is in the solution-2 file.
