# Palindrome Number

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Palindrome Number" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.


## Example 1
### Input:
x = 121
### Output:
true
### Explanation:
121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

## Example 2
### Input:
x = -121
### Output:
false
### Explanation:
From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
