# Isomorphic Strings

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Isomorphic Strings" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.


## Example
### Input:
s = "egg", t = "add"
### Output:
true
