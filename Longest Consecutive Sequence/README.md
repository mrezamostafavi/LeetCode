# Longest Consecutive Sequence

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Longest Consecutive Sequence" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

## Example
### Input:
nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
### Output:
4
### Explanation:
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
