# Valid Palindrome

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Valid Palindrome" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges. The solution merges two sorted integer arrays into a single sorted array in-place.

## Problem Description

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string , return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.


## Example
### Input:
s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
### Output:
true
### Explanation
"amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
