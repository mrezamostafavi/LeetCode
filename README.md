# Merge Sorted Arrays

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Merge Sorted Arrays" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges. The solution merges two sorted integer arrays into a single sorted array in-place.

## Problem Description

You are given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers, `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.

The task is to merge `nums2` into `nums1` such that the final array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The merge must be performed in-place, modifying the array `nums1`.
