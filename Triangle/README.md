# Triangle

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Triangle" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

## Example
### Input:
triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
### Output:
11
### Explanation
The triangle looks like:

2

3 4

6 5 7

4 1 8 3

The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).
