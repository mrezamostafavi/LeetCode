# Factorial Trailing Zeroes

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Factorial Trailing Zeroes" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note that n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.

## Example 1
### Input:
n = 3
### Output:
0


## Example 2
### Input:
n = 5
### Output:
1

# Note
This code includes some additional parts compared to the code I used on LeetCode.
I have two solutions here. While the first one works correctly, it encounters a time limit error on LeetCode. Therefore, I decided to optimize it, and the final result, which is accepted by LeetCode, is in the solution-2 file.
