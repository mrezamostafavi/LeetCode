# Sqrt(x)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Sqrt(x)" problem, commonly encountered in coding interviews and programming challenges.

## Problem Description

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.


## Example
### Input:
x = 8
### Output:
2
### Explanation:
The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
